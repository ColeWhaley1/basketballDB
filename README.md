This is an ongoing project combining my passion for college basketball and computer science. The idea is to create a college "hoops" message 
board for each D1 team. So far, it includes:
- Account system
- SQL database with all D1 teams and their respective conference. Database also stores accounts.
- Basic Framework for adding 'favorite' teams to account
- 'Roster' tab -- still figuring out how to work this
- 'Hoops' Logo
- Several other small additions
